OTRS Easy Docker Installation
========================

What's OTRS?
------------

OTRS is the world most popular Service Desk software, delivered by OTRS Group and a large open source community. You can check more information and all OTRS Group Services in their web site:
http://www.otrs.com

This Docker image is maintained by Complemento, a Brazilian company dedicate to delivery ITSM with open source software. We develop many Free and Enterprise AddOns for OTRS. You can check our website for more information:

About this Image
----------------
This image aims to be a very easy way to get OTRS running, in a few seconds (ok, maybe minutes =D). It includes all dependencies, Apache webserver and Mysql Server as well. It's indicated mainly for testing and educational purpose, since the idea behind Docker is to split all the components in several containers (Web server, Database etc), but it's ok if you have a small company with a few tickets per day.

If you are planning to use OTRS running on Docker in a medium/large production environment, then you should check the option bellow, that includes only the application in a container:
https://hub.docker.com/r/ligero/otrs/

Current OTRS Version: 6.0.4

How to Run it
-------------

 1. Install Docker. You can download Docker Community Edition from this link: 

	https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download

 2. Run the following command:

`docker run -ti --name otrs_easy -v otrs_mysql:/var/lib/mysql -v otrs_app:/opt/otrs -p 80:80 ligero/otrs_easy`

The container will start to load and when see the following lines, you will be able to access OTRS (the time should be different of course):

2017-11-30 01:48:52,119 INFO success: cron entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 1 seconds (startsecs)

2017-11-30 01:48:52,120 INFO success: mysql entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 1 seconds (startsecs)

2017-11-30 01:48:52,120 INFO success: apache2 entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 1 seconds (startsecs)


TIP: If you are not used to Docker, you can hit Ctrl+P+Q at this moment to get back to your system without interrupting the container execution.

You can choose to run also a specific OTRS 6 version:

`docker run -ti --name otrs_easy -v otrs_mysql:/var/lib/mysql -v otrs_app:/opt/otrs -p 80:80 ligero/otrs_easy:6.0.4`

Accessing your OTRS the first time
----------------------------------
If you are running docker from your localhost, just open your browser on:

- **http://localhost/otrs/index.pl**
- **user: root@localhost**
- **password: complemento**

If you turned off your Docker or your computer
----------------------------------------------

In some situations, your OTRS container may be stopped. You can check it status by running:

`docker ps -a`

And see if the container otrs_easy (or wherever you have called it) is stopped or not.

If it's stopped, than you can start it again by running:

`docker start otrs_easy`

More tips about Docker
----------------------

If you are not used to docker, you should know a litle bit more about the command we suggested for you:

`docker run -ti --name otrs_easy -v otrs_mysql:/var/lib/mysql -v otrs_app:/opt/otrs -p 80:80 ligero/otrs_easy`

**-ti**

The parameter -ti is mainly intent to allow us to access the container bash. Always use that


**-v otrs_mysql:/var/lib/mysql -v otrs_app:/opt/otrs**

-v otrs_mysql:/var/lib/mysql -v otrs_app:/opt/otrs creates volumes outside the container. In this case, we are creating external volumes for the mysql files (database) and for the application.
This is important because for persistent your data. It also makes easier the application version update.

Additional parameters for the first run
---------------------------------------
If you are used to Docker, you optionally can define some parameters for the container creation (docker run):
- OTRS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE: You can define the default language, such as pt_BR
- OTRS_FQDN: Define the hostname for all the notifications send from your system
- OTRS_SYSTEM_ID: Defines your OTRS System ID (Check OTRS Manual for more information)

Example:
`docker run -ti --name otrs_easy -v otrs_mysql:/var/lib/mysql -v otrs_app:/opt/otrs -p 80:80 -e OTRS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=pt_BR -e OTRS_FQDN=servicedesk.mycompany.com -e OTRS_SYSTEM_ID=53 ligero/otrs_easy`

Note that these parameters can be only defined during the first run of the Docker. If you didn't specify any of them, then you should change those parameters under OTRS SysConfig.
